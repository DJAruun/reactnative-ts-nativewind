# @djaruun/reactnative-ts-nativewind
## What is it?
`@djaruun/reactnative-ts-nativewind` is a very epic template created for myself to quickly create React Native projects with TypeScript and TailwindCSS/NativeWind preinstalled and ready to use. 

Without giving myself too much praise I've got to say it has a very catchy name too.

## Installing
```shell
npx create-expo-app [project-name] --template @djaruun/reactnative-ts-nativewind
```
